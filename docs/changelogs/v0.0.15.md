### Features

* **Sundial foundational model**: The [Sundial model](https://github.com/thuml/Sundial) has been added to the foundational models hub. Refer to [#xx](https://github.com/AzulGarza/timecopilot/pull/xx) for more details.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from timecopilot.models.foundational.sundial import Sundial

    df = pd.read_csv(
        "https://timecopilot.s3.amazonaws.com/public/data/algeria_exports.csv", 
        parse_dates=["ds"],
    )
    model = Sundial()
    fcst = model.forecast(df, h=12)
    print(fcst)
    ```

### Fixes

* **Enhanced GIFT-Eval Experiment**: The experiment now omits models identified as having potential data leakage, following the latest update to the official evaluation criteria. For more information, refer to [#xx](https://github.com/AzulGarza/timecopilot/pull/xx) and [experiments/gift-eval](https://github.com/AzulGarza/timecopilot/tree/main/experiments/gift-eval).
